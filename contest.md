Unfortunately, I could not finish the task-1 at all as I was started later

But still I managed to implement and complete fully the task 2

Here are the changes that I've made:

Add support for Markdown syntax.

Implemented an AST-based approach

Add support for editing quotes.

Changed the position of the Chat Folders appearance
